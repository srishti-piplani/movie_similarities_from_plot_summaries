# DataCamp Project: Find Movie similarities from Plot summaries

This project has been completed on the DataCamp platform.
The dataset contains the titles of the top 100 movies on IMDb as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.

The purpose of the project is to use NLP to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia and to create clusters based on the same.
Finally, we visualize the similarities by plotting dendrograms.

In this project, NLP and KMeans Clustering have been used for finding out the similarities.
Approach followed:
- Combining Wikipedia and IMDb plot summaries
- Tokenization and Stemming
- Creating TF-IDF
- Creating clusters with KMeans Clustering
- Calculating similarity distances
- Creating and plotting dendograms

#### Packages used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- nltk
- re
